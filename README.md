In the src/underscore_tests.js file there are a bunch of empty function definitions. Your job, is to fill out each function definition so that the tests in SpecRunner.html pass. 

Open up SpecRunner.html in your browser to see which tests are passing and failing. As you write the function definiitons in the underscore_tests.js file, the tests will begin passing.
